# sigma_python_toolbox
My tools box script for sigma

# purpose
My goal is not to replace sigma but to put at disposal the scripts that I think to help me in the creation or the verification.\
I already deleted some of my first scripts thanks of the contribution of the community in the validation tests of the sigma rules.


You can help me by correcting them or by completing the data files\
Please do not hesitate to contribute in any way, I love to learn
